    <p>It's been an exciting journey to where I have arrived today. As a career changer from the hospitality to an  IT
      field, I have learned that I can do whatever I want if the heart is there. I have been certified as a Google
      professional IT Support Specialist via Merit America in 2022. Now I am studying coding at FullStack Academy and
      this is my first attempt to code my very first website.<br>
      In my free time, I like to take long walks with my dog, listen to music, and just spend time with my family. Also,
      I like to bake to try out different recipes.
